Heat some olive oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add the chopped chicken strips and season with salt and pepper. Sauté until golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside.\\n\\n2. In the same pan, add more olive oil if needed, then sauté the minced garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Be careful not to burn it!\\n\\n3. Add the sliced bell peppers to the pan and stir fry until they're tender but still crispy, around 3-4 minutes. Season lightly with salt and pepper.\\n\\n4. Add the diced potatoes to the pan and continue stir frying everything together until the potatoes are cooked through, approximately another 7-8 minutes.\\n\\n5. Return the chicken to the pan and squeeze the freshly squeezed lemon juice over the entire dish. Mix well so that every piece is coated evenly.\\n\\n6. Continue stirring the mixture over medium-high heat until the flavors have melded together nicely. This should take about 2-3 minutes.\\n\\n7. Serve hot with steamed rice, quinoa, or noodles as desired. Enjoy your delicious Lemon Garlic Chicken Bell Pepper Potato Stir Fry!\\n\\nServes: 4\\nCooking Time: Approximately 20 minutes\""
